# astroreport_child

This is the python project to create Saptamsha report of a person as per analysis provided in *Predict with Saptamsha* book written by *Shri V.P.Goel*.

The birth data has to be given in birthdata.py file and update that variable to `birthdata`. You would undertand how to add birth data of the person if you see the file and structure `samplebirthdataname`. Once the birth data is updated then go to file `pdfreport.py` and run the python code and saptamsha pdf report wuld be generated in reports folder if everything is fine.
